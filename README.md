# Laptop Pricing Analysis Dashboard

This project explores and analyzes a laptop pricing dataset using Python, with a focus on visualization and statistical relationships between key features and price.

##  Key Tasks

- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Map encoded values (e.g., GPU, OS, Category) to readable labels
- Visualize numeric and categorical feature relationships with price
- Compute and display Pearson correlation scores
- Create heatmaps and boxplots for feature comparison
- Save all plots for use in presentations or dashboards

##  Output Files

All analysis plots are saved in the `results/` directory:
- `correlation_matrix.png`: Heatmap of feature correlations
- `scatter_plots.png`: Regression plots for numeric features vs Price
- `boxplots.png`: Boxplots of price distribution by categorical features
- `grouped_heatmap.png`: Average price by GPU and CPU core count

##  Requirements

To run the script, install the following packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

 Dataset
Dataset is loaded from the following URL:
```bash
